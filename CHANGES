= 1.1.2 (19/01/2010)

* Added Sass support
  - You can use LessCSS or Sass
  - Sass needs to be installed to work
  - Thanks to Ryan Tomayko for writing Tilt and accepting my LessCSS addition

* Removed RDiscount in favour of Maruku.
  - Still uses RDiscount if you have it
  - Maruku is pure Ruby, no native extensions required

* Added support for JRuby and Macruby
